At its current (and final) state, the program has four functionalities, these can each be accessed via the console by keyboard input:

1- Perform a "simple" (0-100, using "Fizz" and "Buzz") FizzBuzz out to the console
2- Perform a simple FizzBuzz to a file. Asks for a filename from the user
3- Perform a "custom" FizzBuzz with input begining and ending numbers, as well as replaced words instead of "Fizz" and "Buzz" these are taken from a split user input
4- Perform a custom FizzBuzz out to a file. The filename should be entered before the other parameters

Pressing 5 exits the program
Files are output into a directory called "Output" within the solution's directory
